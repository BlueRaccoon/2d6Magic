## Static

| Tier |  School   | Form  |
| :--: | :-------: | :---: |
|  0   | Lightning | Basic |

| (ðŸ—²)  | Once a stormcaller first finds the spark in themselves, the first instinct is to try putting it in anyone and anything else nearby. |
| :--: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|  â—†   | One conductive object you touch is Magnetized for 1 hour. It can be stuck to other connected objects, and smaller objects can be made to float while a short distance away. If you touch two conductive objects, they will stick together (Strength of bond based on Spell Roll) |
|  â†»   | Discharge a static shock into one Connected target, dealing `Lightning-1` damage. [^Connected] This can be used at the moment of contact with a metal weapon, during any Brawl attack, when in water, or when otherwise in contact. |

## Storm Touch

| Tier |  School   | Form  |
| :--: | :-------: | :---: |
|  1   | Lightning | Basic |

|  ðŸ—²   | The most dangerous thing when facing a Stormcaller is a simple touch. Not only can it shock and burn, but once marked, impossible forces draw you together |
| :--: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|  â—†Æ’  | Using a glove or empty hand, make a Close Attack against a target (using your Spell Roll). Deal `Td6(T)` Shock damage on hit, **Disrupt** and **Push** on Crit. While you maintain focus, the target is Marked. You feel a pull towards them as long as they are within 20m of you. |
|  â—‡   | If you have Marked a target with Storm Touch, you can Fly 1/Tier towards or away from your target *(Move 1/Tier to target while ignoring Reactions and Terrain)*. This effect can launch you roughly 5m/Tier. |

## Lightning Bolt

| Tier |  School   | Form  |
| :--: | :-------: | :---: |
|  2   | Lightning | Basic |

|  ðŸ—²ðŸ—²  | The purest expression of the Storm is the most beautiful, and also the most deadly |
| :--: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| â—†â—‡Æ’  | Fire a blinding arc of electricity outwards in a beam. Mark a straight line out 20m, or until hitting a solid wall. The Lightning hits one target in every area on that line (You choose the target, but it must hit something if able). Anyone Connected or in Close Quarters with a target is also affected. Every affected target takes `Lightning+Td6` damage in a Burst Attack, *(reduced by their `â™£Perception`)*. Anyone who takes 3 or more damage is Disrupted, and anyone Injured by the lightning is also Stunned. |

[^Connected]: Shock Damage travels through conductive materials, allowing it to hit multiple targets. Water, salt, acids, and most metals count. If grabbed, touched, or hit with a metal weapon, two targets are considered "connected." In case of large conductive surfaces (metal tower, ocean, etc) damage falls off at roughly 3dmg per area traveled (or 1dmg/meter).
[^Disrupt]: The target is momentarily shocked and dazed. Stances, Spells or other Focused effects, and Planting are all interrupted. If the target has Grabbed someone, they let go (Massive creatures grabbing multiple targets only drop one)
[^ Stun ]: Target has been radically dazed and shaken. They must spend their next Action recovering from Stun, and until they do, all Melee/Brawl attacks against them have Advantage.
[^ Stagger ]: Target has been thrown momentarily off-balance, and loses one Minor Action from their next turn. If a target can't lose any more Minor Actions, they become Stunned instead.
