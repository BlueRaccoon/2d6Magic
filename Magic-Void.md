## Shadowshape [T0 Void]

| Tier | School | Form  |
| :--: | :----: | :---: |
|  0   |  Void  | Basic |

|   (Ω)   | The simplest start is to manipulate the shadows cast by our bodies, before moving on to the shadows cast by our selves. |
| :-----: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ◇ Minor | Manipulate shadows you touch (either touching you or your shadow). The shadows have no physical form, but they can snuff out small lights, play visual tricks, or help conceal or reveal an area. You can stretch a shadow no more than 1 area away from where it was. In pitch darkness, 'shadows' can reach as far as your `Void` skill. |
|    ⚝    | When casting a spell or using a magic item (if your Void Skill matches the spell's Tier), you can have the spell originate from your shadow (or one connected to it) instead of yourself. If this would involve attacking a target, you may use  `♥♦Void` to attack. |

## Inure [T1 Void]

| Tier | School | Form  |
| :--: | :----: | :---: |
|  1   |  Void  | Basic |

|    Ω    | *All who reach into the void must first learn to insulate their minds, lest they risk losing themselves to the unfathomed shadows below* |
| :-----: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ◇ Minor | Bring an eerie calm over your mind. The next time you take Mental Damage this round, reduce the damage by `Void + Tier` |
|  ◆ Act  | Carefully insulate your mind, wrapping it in terrible but understood thoughts, and taking `1d6` Mental Damage. Once during the next day, you can use a ↻Reaction to reduce Mental Damage dealt to any target you are aware of by `Void+Td6`. You can also spread this effect over several targets if needed. |

## Transgression [T2 Void]

| Tier | School | Form  |
| :--: | :----: | :---: |
|  2   |  Void  | Basic |

|       ΩΩ        | *The simplest and yet most dangerous use of the Void is akin to fishing; leave your mind wriggling in the dark, then see what comes to bite* |
| :-------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ◆ƒ Act Focus | Choose a dark thought or emotion to draw upon, summoning an entity and binding it into your shadow (see list below). While under duress, you may need to succeed a `♥♦Will` save to control your thoughts and summon the correct emotion. |
|      ⚝      | If you are Injured by Mental Damage while using this spell, your shadow escapes. It may turn immediately hostile, side with an enemy, or flee to cause havoc. You must retrieve it, or else perform a ritual (T3 Void) to create or steal a new one. |
|        ⚝        | You may also cast this spell on a target by casting this shadow. In this case, the target must hold the emotion and maintain Focus on the spell as though having cast it themselves. |

| Transgress Emotions                                          |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **<u>Anger</u>** *Your shadow wraps your body, bulging and writhing. You brim with violence and power.* Your attacks deal an additional 1d6 damage, and you can use `Void` in place of `♣Body` on rolls.<br> If an attack fails to deal damage, or if you make no attacks during a round, your shadow lashes out at you or a nearby ally for `1d6 Mental` damage. |
| **<u>Spite</u>** *Your shadow lengthens and stands, growing long claws. It has long arms, and you can have it reach out and act on your behalf.* During your turn, you can have your Shadow make a Melee Attack (using your spell bonus) up to `Tier` times, dealing `1d6(T)` Slashing damage to a target and the same amount of Mental Damage to you. You take damage even if the attack misses. |
| **<u>Resentment</u>** *Your shadow floods out to fill nearby shadows, whispering.* Once each round, you can give Disadvantage to any roll (as long as there is shadow in the target's area). If the target still succeeds (or rolls at least `Tier`), you take `2d6 Mental` damage. |
| **<u>Pain</u>** *Your shadow stands back-to-back with you, forming a twisted twitching mirror*. Whenever you take Physical or Pain damage, everything in a Large Area around you (including you) takes `Tier` Mental damage |
| **<u>Fear</u>** *Your shadow looms over you, growing dozens of bloodshot eyes staring in every direction.* All attacks made against you have Disadvantage, and you can use an ◆Action to turn your gaze to one area, forcing everything in it to roll `♥Will/Presence vs Tier` or flee. Each time you take damage or lose an opposed roll, you take `Tier` Mental damage. |
| **<u>Avarice</u>** *Your shadow becomes wide, growing long stretching arms and wide shoveling hands*. Each round your shadow tries to gather an unattended object of some use or worth from within a Large Area around you. If it can't find any, it attempts to steal or wrest away a held or guarded object (use `2d6+Skill+Tier` for relevant rolls). Any objects gathered this way you consider 'yours' for 1d6 days; if any leave your possession, you take `1d6 Mental Damage` per Tier of Value lost [^Value] |
| ***<u>Other</u>***  When drawing upon other emotions, Roll 1d6 to see what happens. **1:** Something Bad; **2-3:** Something Strange (inconsequential); **4-5:** Something Useful with a Cost; **6:** Something Good |

---
[^Value]: Most objects have a 'Tier' associated with them to represent monetary value. Most objects can be bought or sold for a price with a number of digits equal to the Tier (T1=$5, T2=$50, T3=$500, etc)

## Corridor [T3 Void]

| Tier | School | Form  |
| :--: | :----: | :---: |
|  3   |  Void  | Basic |

|      ΩΩΩ      | *Those comfortable with the Void can find expedient routes to any destination, though those foolish enough to be comfortable with the Void may never arrive.* |
| :-----------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ◆◇ Act +Minor | Open a door in nearby shadows, leading to a long Corridor. The Corridor is dangerous, but can lead to any location the caster can accurately imagine. The corridor deals Mental Damage to everyone moving through it based on the distance traveled. *(Those immune to Mental Damage aggrieve the Void, taking half as much Crushing damage).* Anyone Incapacitated by this damage becomes Lost in the Void. |
|       ⚝       | The door lasts up to 10 minutes or until dismissed by the caster. Any number of people can use the corridor in either direction, and the caster has no power to prevent others from using it (except by dismissing the doors). *Frequent use of corridors may draw attention from the Void.* |

| Distance |    Destination    | Corridor Length | Damage |
| :------: | :---------------: | :-------------: | :----: |
|   ~10m   | Across Structures |       10m       |  1d6   |
|  ~100m   |   Across a City   |       20m       |  2d6   |
|   ~5km   |  Across Horizon   |       30m       |  3d6   |
|  ~500km  | Across Continent  |       40m       |  4d6   |
|   ???    |   Across Planes   |       50m       | 4d6+6  |
