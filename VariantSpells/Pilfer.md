# Pilfer
> T1 • Uncommon Spell

A spell commonly learned by thieves and pickpockets. Steal a small item up to 8m away. The item must be unattended, or carried on a target's person (in a bag, pocket, or worn).  
Targets roll `♦Perception vs Spell` to disrupt the effect (with Disadvantage if target is unaware of you).  

**[Anima] Pocket Turncoat :**  
[◆] A small item on the target's person rebels against its owner and tries to run to you (or a person you designate).  
It has 1hp, no Defense, and moves up to `6m/Round`.  
**Enhanced :**
Cast as a `◇MinorAction`

**[Distortion] Pocket Portal :**  
[◆] Attempt to create a portal into a bag, pocket, sachel, quiver, etc. that you can reach into and steal from, or deposit a handheld item into. The portal lasts until end of round.

**[Enchant] Spellthief :**  
[◆] Attempt to steal an ongoing magical effect (of lower tier) from the target and transfer it onto yourself or an ally. If the effect requires concentration, you must concentrate on it.

**[Illusion] Misplace :**  
[◆i] Obscure a small object on the target's person. It becomes invisible to sight and touch, as though it was missing. The caster can still percieve it.  

**[Lightning] Magnet Snatch :**  
[◆] Steal one or more conductive/metal objects on the target's person, or give them Disadvantage to using a metal object in hand this round.  
**Enhanced:**
Cast as a ◇Minor Action

**[Scry] Tracking Beacon :**  
[◇i] Enchant one object on the target's person. While concentrating, you can tell exactly where that object is. Concentration may become difficult at extreme distances (at GM discretion)  
**Enhanced :**
You can see/hear from that object while it is up to 10m away

**[Solidics] Pickpocket :**  
[◇] Attempt to levitate an item out of an exposed pocket, bag, quiver, etc. It can't operate buttons/snaps/etc or exert force, but will otherwise fly to your hand. *(Assume the spell can affect items that a target can rapidly access)*

**[Transmutation] Forgery :**  
[◇i] Take note an object visible on the target's person. As long as you hold concentration, you can later create a nearly perfect copy of that item with adequate materials, or a convincing fascimilie out of random materials.  
Functional magical properties of artifacts are not copied, but the item will seem identical to magic senses of equal tier (similar to a Disguise spell).

**[Void] Impcurse :**  
[◆] Place a subtle curse on an item. The next night, `1d6/Tier` Imps will emerge from shadows near the item and attempt to steal it (along with several other items nearby). The imps are not beholden to you, and will not attempt to return the item to you.
